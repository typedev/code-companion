# Cross-Machine Sync — Implementation Plan

> On approval, the first implementation action is to copy this plan into
> `docs/plan-sync-across-machines.md` (per CLAUDE.md rule 2) and track checkpoint
> progress there.

## Context

The user works on the same projects from two machines (desktop + laptop, same OS
user `alexander`). Claude Code's per-project **history** (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/*.jsonl`)
and **memory** (`<encoded>/memory/*.md`) live under `~/.claude` and today do **not**
travel between machines — only what's committed to each project's own git repo does.
Goal: let the user finish a session on one machine, click **Sync**, and continue on the
other with the conversation history and project memory already loaded.

Design constraints agreed with the user:
- **Backend**: a private git repo — `https://github.com/typedev/code-companion-sync`.
- **Trigger**: a **manual "Sync" button in the Project Manager**, one bidirectional
  `pull --rebase` + `push` per click. No daemon, no auto-sync in MVP.
- **Safety first**: a bad sync (e.g. a future Claude Code layout change) must never break
  the working state; recovery is possible even at the cost of losing the last sync.
- **Concurrency rule** (user-accepted): the *same* project must not be edited on both
  machines simultaneously; *different* projects on the two machines must be safe.

## What syncs (scope) — MVP "selected" mode

| Layer | Source | Into sync repo |
|---|---|---|
| Per-project history | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/*.jsonl` | `projects/<id>/sessions/` |
| Per-project memory | `<encoded>/memory/*.md` + `MEMORY.md` | `projects/<id>/memory/` |
| Per-project config slice | whitelisted `~/.claude.json → projects[<abs>]` | `projects/<id>/claude-config.json` |
| Global plans | `~/.claude/plans/*.md` | `global/plans/` |
| Global settings | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `global/settings.json` |

**Never synced**: `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, whole `~/.claude.json`, caches,
`shell-snapshots/`, `session-env/`, `file-history/` (100M), lock files.
`hasTrustDialogAccepted` is **excluded** from the config whitelist by default (syncing it
would silently auto-trust the project on machine 2). Default whitelist:
`["allowedTools","mcpServers","enabledMcpjsonServers"]`.

## Sync repo layout (keyed by machine-independent project_id)

```
manifest.json                     # {schemaVersion, appVersion}
projects/<id>/meta.json           # {project_id, id_source, canonical_remote, display_name}
projects/<id>/memory/*.md, MEMORY.md
projects/<id>/sessions/*.jsonl
projects/<id>/claude-config.json  # whitelisted .claude.json slice
global/settings.json
global/plans/*.md
```

Materialized on each machine into the **local** `~/.claude/projects/<local-encoded>/`
where `local-encoded = encode_project_path(local_abs_path)` — this id→path remap is what
makes different repo locations across machines work.

## project_id resolution (`src/utils/project_identity.py`)

`resolve_project_identity(path) -> ProjectIdentity | None`:
1. **Has git `origin`** → `id = slug(normalize_remote_url(origin))`
   (`github.com/typedev/code-companion` → `github.com_typedev_code-companion`). Deterministic,
   identical on both machines.
2. **Git repo, no remote** → **root-commit hash** (`git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD`,
   lexicographically smallest if several). Stable across clones, **no writes to the repo**.
3. **Git repo, no commits** → opt-in committed `.code-companion/project-id` (UUID) — last resort only.
4. **Not a git repo** → `None` → **not syncable** (badge "no sync"). A path-derived id would
   differ per machine and defeat sync; surfaced as a limitation.

## The correctness core — hash-based 3-way merge

The hazard the user named ("two different projects on two machines") is solved by treating
**this machine's last-synced file hashes as the merge base**. Never uses mtime — only
`sha256(bytes)`.

- **State store** `~/.config/code-companion/sync_state.json`: per project_id, `{rel_path: sha256, last_synced}`.
- **Export (local → repo), dirty-only**: a file is written to the repo only if
  `h_local != h_base` (locally changed since last sync). Files where `h_local == h_base`
  are left as whatever `pull --rebase` brought (adopt the other machine's version). So a
  machine that didn't touch project X never overwrites X.
  - **First-contact adoption rule (mandatory, the real risk)**: when `h_base` is absent,
    export only files **absent** in the repo (seed genuinely-new); never overwrite divergent
    repo files — reconcile as conflicts on import. Prevents the first sync from clobbering a
    populated repo.
  - **Sessions** (`*.jsonl`, unique names, append-only) = **union**; on same-name/diff-content
    prefer the longer byte length (append-only ⇒ superset). Never deleted.
  - **Deletions are not exported** (additive-only); cross-machine delete propagation is
    out of scope for MVP (would need tombstones) — documented.
- **Import (repo → local), safe additive**: `snapshot → materialize to temp → validate →
  atomic rename`. Both sides changed same file ⇒ **CONFLICT**: keep local, stash repo copy
  in the snapshot as `<name>.remote`, mark badge — never destructive. Additive: never deletes
  a local file absent from the payload. `.claude.json` applied by surgical field patch, never
  whole-file. Validation: every `*.json` parses; `*.jsonl` tolerant of a partial trailing line.

## Safety / recovery

- Every import snapshots the target subtree to `~/.config/code-companion/sync-snapshots/<iso>/`
  (machine-local, **not** synced) — the escape hatch that a bad sync cannot corrupt.
- **Schema guard**: if repo `manifest.schemaVersion > SCHEMA_VERSION`, quarantine — refuse
  import, mark ERROR, leave local untouched (protects an older machine against a newer one).
- **Crash recovery** (`sync_recovery.recover`): heal a clone left mid-rebase (abort) or with
  unpushed commits; fall back to `settings.sync.last_good_commit` if corrupt.
- **Never force-push**; `pull --rebase --autostash`; on `RebaseConflict` abort + mark conflict + skip push.

## Module breakdown

**New files**
- `src/utils/git_auth.py` — auth extracted from `GitService` (`normalize_remote_url`,
  `is_auth_error`, `get_stored_credentials`, `store_credentials`, `build_auth_env` →
  GIT_ASKPASS env). Reused by both `GitService` and `SyncRepo`.
- `src/utils/claude_paths.py` — centralize `~/.claude` layout (all from `Path.home()`):
  `project_dir/project_memory_dir/project_sessions/plans_dir/settings_json/claude_json`.
- `src/utils/project_identity.py` — id algorithm above.
- `src/models/sync.py` — `SyncState` enum, `ProjectSyncStatus`, `SyncResult`, `FileEntry`, `SCHEMA_VERSION=1`.
- `src/services/sync_repo.py` — thin git-CLI wrapper for the single clone: `clone`,
  `pull_rebase`, `push`, `commit_all`, `head_hash`, `is_mid_rebase`/`abort_rebase`,
  `hard_reset_to`. Raises `AuthenticationRequired` (reused) + new `RebaseConflict`.
- `src/services/sync_state_store.py` — the per-machine hash base manifest (load/save like `ProjectRegistry`).
- `src/services/sync_engine.py` — **pure** export/import/snapshot/validate/slice (no git,
  no network → unit-testable): `hash_file`, `export_project`, `import_project`,
  `extract_claude_json_slice`, `apply_claude_json_slice`.
- `src/services/sync_recovery.py` — `recover(repo, settings)`.
- `src/services/sync_service.py` — **singleton orchestrator** mirroring
  `ProjectStatusService` (thread-off-main, JSON status cache `sync_status_cache.json`,
  `GLib.idle_add`): `is_configured`, `get_cached_status`, `sync(credentials, progress) -> SyncResult`.
  Owns the `SyncLock`, schema guard, ordering, base + `last_good_commit` updates.
- `src/services/sync_lock.py` — `SyncLock` mirroring `ProjectLock` (hashed file in
  `/tmp/code-companion-locks/`), guards the shared clone across the multi-process app.

**Existing files touched**
- `src/services/git_service.py` — replace private auth helpers with delegations to
  `git_auth.py` (behaviour-preserving).
- `src/services/settings_service.py` — add to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`:
  `"sync": {"enabled": False, "repo_url": "https://github.com/typedev/code-companion-sync",
  "last_good_commit": "", "mode": "selected", "claude_json_fields":
  ["allowedTools","mcpServers","enabledMcpjsonServers"]}`.
- `src/project_manager.py` — Sync button in header next to `refresh_button` (~L127);
  `_on_sync_clicked` worker cloned from `_on_refresh_clicked` (spinner, `AuthenticationRequired`
  → `show_github_credentials_dialog` → retry with creds); `row.sync_badges` slot in
  `_create_project_row` (~L293) + `_render_sync_badges`; sync CSS in `_BADGE_CSS`; cached-status
  paint on load; first-run "Configure sync…" dialog to confirm/save `sync.repo_url` + enable.

## End-to-end Sync sequence (`SyncService.sync`, under SyncLock)

```
acquire SyncLock (else return PAUSED)
0. repo = SyncRepo(config_dir/sync, settings.sync.repo_url); clone if missing; recover()
1. repo.pull_rebase(creds)
2. schema guard on manifest.json (too new → ERROR all, abort)
3. IMPORT inbound per syncable project (snapshot→temp→validate→atomic; record conflicts)
4. EXPORT outbound per project (dirty-only vs base; first-contact adoption rule)
5. changed = repo.commit_all("sync <host> <iso>")
6. if changed: pull_rebase (RebaseConflict → abort + mark CONFLICT + skip push) ; else push
7. update manifest if we bump; 
8. state_store.set_base(id, current hashes); settings.sync.last_good_commit = head; write status cache
release SyncLock   # AuthenticationRequired bubbles to _on_sync_clicked → creds dialog → retry
```
Import-before-export so export sees merged state and can't regress it. Step 8's base update
("what both sides now agree on") is the linchpin.

## Badge states (reuse `_make_badge` + new `cc-badge-*` CSS)

`NOT_CONFIGURED` (non-git / disabled) · `SYNCED` ✓ · `AHEAD` ↑ (pushed) · `BEHIND` ↓ (imported)
· `CONFLICT` (red, tooltip lists files + snapshot path) · `PAUSED` (lock held) · `ERROR` (schema/auth/git)
· `SYNCING` (spinner).

## Checkpoints (each independently testable)

- **CP0 — Scaffolding, no behavior change**: extract `git_auth.py` (delegations kept),
  add `claude_paths.py`, `sync.*` defaults, empty `models/sync.py`. Regression: app + git unchanged.
- **CP1 — Identity + state store (pure/unit)**: `project_identity.py`, `sync_state_store.py`.
- **CP2 — Sync engine (pure, no network)**: `sync_engine.py` export/import/snapshot/validate/slice.
  Table-driven 3-way tests (dirty-only export, additive import, conflict, JSONL partial line).
- **CP3 — SyncRepo + lock + recovery** against a local bare repo.
- **CP4 — SyncService orchestration (headless)**: steps 1–8, schema guard, status cache;
  two-clone harness (below), no GTK.
- **CP5 — UI integration = MVP done**: Sync button, worker + auth retry, `_render_sync_badges`,
  cached paint, first-run config dialog. Manual + two-HOME run.
- **CP6 (post-MVP) — Backup mode**: `sync.mode="backup"` exports all registered projects +
  `projects.json` registry into `global/registry.json`, no retention, still additive; import
  offers to register unknown ids. This is the "clean OS reinstall" restore path.

## Verification (no second physical machine needed)

Everything derives from `Path.home()`, so simulate machines via `HOME` override:
1. Bare remote: `git init --bare /tmp/sync-remote.git`.
2. Machine A (`HOME=/tmp/mA`): seed `~/.claude/projects/<enc>/…`, a project repo with origin
   (or root commit), register, `sync()` → assert repo populated + base updated.
3. Machine B (`HOME=/tmp/mB`): clone the *project* (same id), register, `sync()` → assert
   local materialized via id→path remap, additively.
4. Different-project concurrency (A edits X, B edits Y) → assert no clobber, both converge.
5. Same-file conflict → second syncer gets CONFLICT, no overwrite, snapshot retained.
6. First-contact adoption (B has divergent pre-existing local) → both kept, no clobber.
7. Crash recovery (kill between commit and push) → next `sync()` recovers.
8. Schema guard (bump remote schemaVersion) → import refused, local untouched.

Package 2–8 as pytest cases sharing one bare remote (HOME swap + fresh singletons) — CI-able.

## Open items / user prep
- Ensure git push/pull auth to `code-companion-sync` works on both machines (HTTPS token or SSH).
- Non-git project folders are not syncable in MVP (by design).
- Cross-machine file *deletion* propagation is out of scope for MVP.

## Implementation status (updated as of this session)

- [x] **CP0 — Scaffolding**: `git_auth.py` (auth extracted from GitService), `claude_paths.py`, `models/sync.py`, `sync.*` settings. Behaviour-preserving; smoke-verified.
- [x] **CP1 — Identity + state store**: `project_identity.py`, `sync_state_store.py`. 13 tests.
- [x] **CP2 — Sync engine**: `sync_engine.py` (3-way merge, dirty-only export, additive import, conflict, sessions union, JSONL sanitize, `.claude.json` slice). 33 tests.
- [x] **CP3 — SyncRepo + lock + recovery**: `sync_repo.py`, `sync_lock.py`, `sync_recovery.py`. 10 tests against a local bare repo.
- [x] **CP4 — SyncService orchestration**: `sync_service.py` (steps 0–8, schema guard, status cache, global plans/settings). 4 two-machine HOME-override tests: roundtrip, different-projects-no-clobber, non-destructive same-file conflict, schema guard.
- [x] **CP5 — Project Manager UI**: Sync button, `_on_sync_clicked` worker + auth-retry dialog, `_render_sync_badges`, cached-status paint, first-run "Configure sync…" dialog. Import-verified; mirrors the proven `_on_refresh_clicked` pattern.
- [x] **CP6 — Backup mode**: `sync.mode="backup"` writes `global/registry.json` (additive union by id, with cloneable remote URL); `list_restorable()` surfaces backed-up projects absent locally; `restore_project()` clones + registers them (then a follow-up Sync materializes their data). UI: sync-options menu (Configure / Backup mode toggle / Restore from backup…) with a folder-picker restore dialog. Header buttons now use the Material **git** and **claude** icons (were near-identical stock symbolic icons). 2 backend tests.

Total: **62 tests passing**, ruff clean. pytest added to dev deps; `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` added to pyproject.
